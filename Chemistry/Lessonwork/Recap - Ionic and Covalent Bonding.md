# Ionic
The positive and negative ions, the cations and anions respectively, attract each other. They build up to form giant structures of alternating charges. **It is the mutual electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged ions.**
## Properties
The giant ionic lattice gives the compounds their properties:
- Exceedingly high melting and boiling points
	- The electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged ions is strong, and takes a lot of energy to break.
- Being hard solids
- Brittle and easily cleaved
	- A small amount of force is required to shift the ions to go from being in line with alternating charges to being in line with the same charge. This creates a repulsion force which breaks the structure apart.
- Soluble in water
	- Ions in the lattice are attracted to water molecules and break off to float around individually (covered in later topics)
- Conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water
	- They do not do this when solid as the ions are fixed in place and cannot carry a charge.
	- When dissolved or molten the ions are free to move and carry charge.

## Example Questions
**Which compound will have the higher melting point and why? $MgO$ or $NaCl$?**
$MgO$ as the magnesium and oxygen atoms form $2^+$ and $2^-$ ions which have a stronger electrostatic force of attraction, taking more energy to split them apart.
**Which compound will have the higher melting point and why? $MgO$ or $CaO$?**
MgO as there is less shielding on the magnesium atom, so the positive and negative ions are closer together, so there is a stronger electrostatic force of attraction.
# Covalent bonding
A strong electrostatic force of attraction between a shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the bonded non-metal atoms.
