Ionisation energy is the amount of energy you need to remove an electron from an atom until it becomes an ion.

**PRECISE DEFINITION**
The 1st ionisation energy: The energy required to remove one electron from each atom in a mole of gaseous atoms producing one mole of 1+ gaseous ions.
The 2nd ionisation energy: The energy required to remove one electron from a 1+ ion to create a 2+ electron. 1+ $\to$ 2+ not 0 $\to$ 2+
e.g.
	1st IE of $\text{Na}_{(g)}\to Na^+_{(g)}+e^-$
	2nd IE of $Na^+_{(g)}\to Na^{2+}_{(g)}+e^-$

# Trends in the graph[^1]
1. Going down a group, there are more shells. This provides more shielding and a larger atomic radius, causing a lesser ionisation energy as the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and valence electron is weaker.
2. Going across the period, there are more protons. This means there is a stronger attraction to the valence electrons, making it harder to remove electrons. As the attraction is stronger, the atomic radius is smaller, making an atom like fluorine smaller than lithium despite having more protons and electrons.

A p-orbital has a higher energy level, meaning it requires less energy to remove electrons.
## Dips
1. Between nitrogen and oxygen, there is a dip as oxygen has two electrons in the same orbital, whereas nitrogen has one electron in each orbital.
2. There is also a dip between beryllium and boron as boron has a 2p electron.
