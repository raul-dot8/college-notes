# Electronegativity
The power of an atom to attract the electrons in a covalent bond.

## Factors affecting electronegativity
- Nuclear charge - the more protons, the stronger the attraction from the nucleus to the bonding pair of electrons.
- Atomic radius - the closer the bonding electrons to the nucleus, the stronger the attraction from the nucleus to the bonding pair of electrons.
- Shielding - the less shells of electrons shielding (repelling) the bonding electrons, the stronger the attraction from the nucleus to the bonding pair of electrons.

## Polar and non-polar bonds
If an atom has a greater electronegativity than the other, it will pull more on the other atom. This is indicated by $\delta^-$ for the more electronegative atom, and $\delta^+$ for the less electronegative charge. This means that there is a partial negative charge. This has a permanent dipole. For example:
$$
H^{\delta^+}—\text{ }Cl^{\delta^-}
$$
$C-H$ has no dipole, unlike most molecules with H atoms.

In $H_{2}O$, the bonds are polar, and the molecule is polar. The molecule is not polar and the dipoles do not cancel out.
In $CO_{2}$, the bonds are polar, but the molecule is non-polar, as the dipoles cancel out, due to the molecule being symmetrical.
