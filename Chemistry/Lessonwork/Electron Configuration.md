# Shells, Sub-shells, and Orbitals
Shells are still present and contain subshells, which are in turn containing orbitals, which is where electrons are most likely to be found.
Orbitals can hold 0, 1, or 2 electrons, where each have opposite spins.

| Shell | Sub-shell | Orbital              | Max. $\text{e}^{-}$ |
| ----- | --------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1     | s         | s has 1 orbital      | 2 (1s2)             |
| 2     | s p       | p has 3 orbitals     | 8 (2s2 2p6)         |
| 3     | s p d     | d has 5 orbitals     | 18 (3s2 3p6 3d10)   |
| 4     | s p d f   | f has 7 orbitals[^1] |                     |

#### The 4s subshell which is filled first is also emptied first.

# Transition metals
Transition metals are defined as d-block elements that form at least one ion with a partially filled d-orbital.
