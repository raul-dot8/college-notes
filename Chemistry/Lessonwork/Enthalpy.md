# Endothermic and exothermic
In a reaction, bonds must break before they can be made. Bond breaking is endothermic process as it takes energy to break the bonds. Making bonds is an exothermic process as energy is released to the surroundings.
# What is enthalpy?
Enthalpy is the measure of the total energy of a system.[^1] We cannot directly measure it, as it is the energy stored in a system. Such, we measure the enthalpy changes in a system.
## RTP
In chemistry, the standard properties are $25\degree C$ and $101~kPa~/~1~atm$ and a standard concentration of $1~mol~dm^{-3}$. We denote the change in enthalpy and standard conditions with $\Delta H \text{ and } \Delta H^{⦵}$.

Bond enthalpy is the average energy required to break 1 mole of covalent bonds in gaseous molecules.[^2]
