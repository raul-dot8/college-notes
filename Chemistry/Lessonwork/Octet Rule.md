# Octet Rule
Atoms want to gain or lose electrons such that they have a full outer shell, like their next nearest noble gas.
#### Electron Deficiency
- Atoms in molecules with too few electrons are deemed 'electron deficient'.
- Examples include $B$ and $Be$ which are in the second energy level. This is because they have less than 4 outer electrons in the second energy level, so the noble gas configuration cannot be reached.
#### Expanded Octets
- Atoms in molecules with too many electrons are termed 'electron rich' and have an 'expanded octet'. 
- Only atoms from the third row of the periodic table can expand their octets. This is because in the third energy level, the outer shell can hold 18 electrons, so more electrons are available. $P, S, \text{and } Cl$ can expand their octets.
#### Dative / Co-ordinate bonds
A non-bonding (or lone pair of electrons) from one atom are shared with another atom. An example of this is in ammonia bonding with boron trifluoride.

# Electron Pair Repulsion Theory
Electrons have rules:
- Electrons pair up around a central atom
- They repel as they have like charges
- Always as far away as possible
Electron pairs always are either bonding or non-bonding/lone pairs. Double or triple covalent bonds are treated as a bonding region/area of electron density. Lone pairs have greater repulsion than bonding pairs, thus reducing bond angles.
bonded/bonded < bonded/line < lone/lone
