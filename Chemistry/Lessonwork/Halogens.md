# Uses of chlorine
## As a disinfectant
Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for drinking water.
When small amounts of chlorine are added to drinking water, a disproportionation reaction takes place where 2 different acids are made, one of which is an oxoacid in which chlorine has an oxidation state of +1.
$$
Cl_{2~(l)}+H_{2}O_{(l)} \to HClO_{(aq)} + HCl_{(aq)}
$$
The chloric acid, $HClO$ and the chlorate ions $ClO^-$ kill bacteria.
## As bleach
When chlorine reacts with cold dilute $NaOH$, a disproportionation reaction takes place where 3 products are formed, one of which is an oxyanion, in which chlorine has an oxidation state of +1.
$$
Cl_{2~(g)} + 2NaOH_{(aq)} \to NaClO_{(aq)} + NaCl_{(aq)} + H_{2}O_{(l)}
$$
