## What is an oxidation number/state?
The oxidation number is a measure of how many far the electrons have moved towards or away from the nucleus in the atom's normal state. It is also how many electrons have been lost or gained.
## Assigning Oxidation Numbers
### Ionic compounds
For ionic compounds, oxidation numbers can be assigned using the expected charges from the periodic table.
Alkali metals are always +1
Rare earth metals are always +2
Group 13 boron is always +3
Group 5 nonmetals are -3
Group 6 are -2
Halogens are -1
#### Transition metals (in ionic compounds)
The transition metals have variable oxidation states which depend on the anion.

### Covalent compounds
Generally[^1], the last element written in a compound is the most electronegative, and becoming closer to fluorine. This element keeps its negative oxidation number. Other nonmetals must adapt to keep the compound neutral.

For example, the molecule $OF_2$ shows that fluorine is the more electronegative element, as it is the latter element. It keeps its normal oxidation number and then oxygen must adapt.

It becomes easier to resolve oxidation numbers, and it is advisable to, split molecules into the polyatomic ions you know and then the other ions. For example:

$$
Pb(OH)_{4} \to Pb^{4+} \text{ and } O^{-2} \text{ and } H^{+1}
$$
### Rules:
- The oxidation number of a neutral element is zero.
- Fluorine always has an oxidation number of -1 in compounds. Never anything else.
- The element of groups I (e.g. $Na, K$), II (e.g. $Mg, Ca$), and III (e.g. $B, Al$), always have positive oxidation numbers in compounds.
- Hydrogen has oxidation number +1 in all its compounds aside from binary and ternary compounds where the only other atoms are metals or boron.
- Oxygen has an oxidation number of -2 in compounds, except for some compounds when combined with F, to which rules 2-4 apply. Oxygen, as the peroxide ion ($O_{2}^{2-}$) has an oxidation number of -1 (for example in $H_2 O_2$)
- The elements of groups V, VI, and VII, have oxidation numbers of -3, -2, and -1, respectively, when found in binary compounds with metals or hydrogen.

### Naming Inorganic Compounds
- Positive ion first
- Then the negative ion
Everything except group 1, group 2, hydrogen, or oxygen do not need roman numerals to identify their charge.
##### Examples:
- $FeCl_3$ is iron (III) chloride
- $NaNO_3$ is sodium nitrate (V)
- $H_2 SO_4$ is sulfuric (VI) acid
