Redox reactions will always have an element which is reduced and an element which is oxidised.

Oxidation:
Gain of oxygen
Loss of electrons
Increase in oxidation number

Reduction:
Loss of oxygen
Gain of electrons
Reduction in oxidation number

Disproportionation is when an element is oxidised and reduced.
For example, $Cu$ in this reaction:
$$
2\text{ } \mathop{CuCl}_{\text{+1~~~-1}} \to Cu\text{ }+\text{ }CuCl_{2}
$$
is both reduced and oxidised. Its oxidation number goes from +1 to 0 and +2.
