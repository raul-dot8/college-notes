Intermolecular forces are the forces between molecules. When you boil a simple compound, these are the bonds that are broken, rather than the $O-H$ bonds (in $H_2O$) or similar.

# Types
## London forces
#### Definition
These intermolecular forces are found between all molecules, though there could well be other other ones involved.
#### Causation
The random movement of electrons causes them to create a dipole, due to more of them being on one side more than the other. These last a very short time, are very weak, and are known as instantaneous dipoles.
### Behaviour
#### Induction of dipoles in neighbouring atoms (Induced dipole-dipole interactions)
When atoms are close enough, the dipole causes another dipole in a neighbouring atom. The extremely small positive charge on one end of an instantaneous dipole will attract negative electrons, such inducing another dipole.
### Examples
#### Halogens
Bromine is a liquid as there are more electrons, causing there to be stronger London forces throughout the molecule, in comparison to fluorine, which is a gas.
## Permanent dipole-dipole
#### Definition
The dipole in a molecule that has elements of differing electronegativities. These are the polar/permanent dipoles.
#### Causation
The differing electronegativities of molecules causes one end to be more negative than the other, causing a dipole that never changes.
## Hydrogen bonds
#### Definition
A special type of hydrogen bond that is found between molecules containing the following:
- An electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons, for example: oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine
- A hydrogen atom attached to either $N$, $O$ or $F$.
#### Special case/example
Hydrogen bonding in water means that the density of ice is lower than as a liquid, as it creates tetrahedral hydrogen bonds, causing a large open structure. When ice melts, the water molecules fall into the open space, reducing its density.
