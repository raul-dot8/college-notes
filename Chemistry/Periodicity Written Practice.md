1. State and explain the following trends:
	1. atomic radius across period 3
		Atomic radius across period 3 decreases because of the rising atomic charge. This increases the attraction to the electrons, drawing them closer inwards. The shielding provided by the shells does not change, as the amount of shells does not change. 
	2. general trend in ionisation energy across period 3
		Ionisation energy across period 3 increases due to the stronger attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electrons. This attraction increases because of the smaller atomic radius and greater nuclear charge. This means more energy is required to remove the first electron.
	3. electronegativity across period 3
		Electronegativity increases across period 3 as nuclear charge increases and atomic radius decreases. This increases the attraction of the paired electrons to the nucleus.
