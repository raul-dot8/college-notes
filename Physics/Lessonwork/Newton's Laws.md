Newton's first law says that an object in motion will stay in motion travelling in a straight line at a constant speed unless an external force acts upon it. This also applies to objects at rest.
## 2
Newton's second law is characterised by the equation $F=m \cdot a$
We can substitute in $\frac{v-u}{t}$ for $a$ to create a new equation, being $$
F_{resultant} = \frac{mv-mu}{t}
$$This denotes that the change in momentum over time is equal to the resultant force.

Newton's third law describes that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The forces are equal, of the same type, and occur in pairs, acting on different bodies.
