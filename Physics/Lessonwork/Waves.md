# What is a wave?
A wave is a transfer of energy without a net transfer of mass. Ordinary waves are progressive.
# Types of waves
## Transverse
The direction of oscillation (of the particles or the fields) is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the net energy transfer.
## Longitudinal
The direction of oscillation of the particles is parallel to the direction of propagation of the net energy transfer.
Generally, these are often mechanical waves, found in the three states of matter as the particles of the material interact with each other. These are never found in an electromagnetic waves or fields.
## Mechanical
Waves travelling through media such as solid, liquid, and gas. The particles oscillating have a mass. This type of wave cannot propagate through a vacuum.
## Electromagnetic
The oscillation of an electric and a perpendicular magnetic field. This wave is massless and can propagate through a vacuum.

# Electric, Magnetic, and Direction
All 3 of these (the electric field, magnetic field, and the direction of propagation) are perpendicular to each other. The two fields are in phase.

# Properties of a wave
Waves have 5 key properties:
- Amplitude ($A$)
- Period ($T$)
- Wavelength ($\lambda$)
- Frequency ($F$) = $\frac{1}{T}$
- Wave-speed ($v$) = $\frac{\lambda}{T} = \frac{f}{\lambda}$
- Polarisation
- Phase

## Polarisation
### Plane polarised wave
A plane polarised wave is a wave that only oscillates in one direction and propagates perpendicularly.
These must be **transverse** and **of one polarisation angle**.
### Unpolarised waves
Unpolarised waves are comprised of many different waves of different polarisations.
## Antennas
When moving a lot of electrons back and forth through a wire, they will create a magnetic field, which means that there is inherently an electric field, which can then be picked up by a wire in the same polarisation.

## Polarising Filters
Light of one polarisation is completely blocked by another polarising filter at 90$\degree$ to it. 
Red light is 700nm, and violet light is at 400nm. This means that the polarising filter's bars would need to be very close to polarise/block this light.

## Phase
Phase is the difference between points on waves.

## Interference
Waves of the same frequency, wave-speed, and wavelength etc., are called coherent. Amplitude does not need to be the same to be coherent.
When coherent waves cross, they do NOT collide. This is because there is not real permanent effect, like in a collision in momentum.
The principle of superposition is present at the intersection point. This signifies that the displacement of the waves is summed, as the waves are superposed[^1] on each other.

# Young's Double-slit formula
To find $\lambda$ in a two-source experiment we COULD use $\lambda = \sqrt{ y^2 +(x+w)^2} - \sqrt{ y^2 + (x-w)^2 }$  but it is lengthy and hard to rearrange for $y$. To do this in a better way:

Using this formula, we can predict and calculate what happens when we change any of those variables, and it is easily visible on https://scpedu.barton.ac.uk/doubleslit2.htm with tweaks.
# Diffraction and slit size
Diffraction is caused by the edges that a wave passes by. Slit size affects the pattern as seen in the formula. The optimum gap of a slit (optimising the effect of diffraction and the amount of energy that comes through the gap) is one wavelength. This creates ideal circular patterns, seeing as the waves diffracted through a gap become more circular with a smaller gap, until the point where energy is reduced.

## White light
When white light is shone through the double slit, it creates a rainbow pattern, with a central white.

![[Figure_28_04_01a-1.jpg]]

The light in the centre is white because the path difference for the wavelengths is zero, and all the light arrives in the same place. At the next maxima, the colours separate as, in accordance with the formula, differing $\lambda$ values cause different $w$ values. Further out into the second and third-order maxima, ($n=2,~ ~n=3$), the colours overlap as they are shifted further and further apart.
The blue wavelengths are on the inside as they have shorter wavelengths than red, meaning they are shifted less.
# Single slit diffraction
Huygens suggested that all waves are made up of an infinite number of tiny point sources, named wavelets. Primary wavelets are the 'wave' and the secondary wavelets are all of the points on it.
This idea explains single slit diffraction's strange phenomena of having maxima on either side. These side maxima are half of the width of the central maxima. 
A formula exists, but you do not need to know it, or use it. You must be able to explain around it though, without citing it etc.
$$
\displaylines{
\lambda=\frac{a\cdot x}{D} \\
\text{Where a is the slit size, x is the distance to the dark spot, and D is the distance to the screen.}
}
$$
It is the same equation as the double slit equation, but minor changes. $w$ is replaced for $x$ and it is not to the maxima, but to the dark spot. $s$ is replaced for $a$, still slit width.
# The relationship between the intensity/patterns of double and single slit
At the position of the peak in the double slit graph, the single slit graph has the same intensity.[^2]
Intensity is directly proportional to the square of amplitude. ($I\propto A^2$)
The intensity vs position graph for a single slit, gives the maximum intensity for the peaks of the double slit intensity (vs position).
# Diffraction grating
We are **NOT** using the small-angle approximation. The only approximation being used is the visible right angle. The experiment notated below is accurate, but not precise. The data found is with experimental uncertainty.

[^1]: You must NOT write **superimpose**. You will be awarded 0 marks.
[^2]: It is key to use both **intensity** and **position** in your answer, as they are the axes of the graph.
