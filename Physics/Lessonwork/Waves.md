# What is a wave?
A wave is a transfer of energy without a net transfer of mass. 
# Types of waves
## Transverse
The direction of oscillation (of the particles or the fields) is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the net energy transfer.
## Longitudinal
The direction of oscillation of the particles is parallel to the direction of propagation of the net energy transfer.
Generally, these are often mechanical waves, found in the three states of matter as the particles of the material interact with each other. These are never found in an electromagnetic waves or fields.
## Mechanical
Waves travelling through media such as solid, liquid, and gas. The particles oscillating have a mass. This type of wave cannot propagate through a vacuum.
## Electromagnetic
The oscillation of an electric and a perpendicular magnetic field. This wave is massless and can propagate through a vacuum.

# Electric, Magnetic, and Direction
All 3 of these (the electric field, magnetic field, and the direction of propagation) are perpendicular to each other. The two fields are in phase.

# Properties of a wave
Waves have 5 key properties:
- Amplitude ($A$)
- Period ($T$)
- Wavelength ($\lambda$)
- Frequency ($F$) = $\frac{1}{T}$
- Wave-speed ($v$) = $\frac{\lambda}{T} = \frac{f}{\lambda}$
- Polarisation
- Phase

# Polarisation
## Plane polarised wave
A plane polarised wave is a wave that only oscillates in one direction and propagates perpendicularly.
These must be **transverse** and **of one polarisation angle**.
## Unpolarised waves
Unpolarised waves are comprised of many different waves of different polarisations.
# Antennas
When moving a lot of electrons back and forth through a wire, they will create a magnetic field, which means that there is inherently an electric field, which can then be picked up by a wire in the same polarisation.

# Polarising Filters
Light of one polarisation is completely blocked by another polarising filter at 90$\degree$ to it. 
Red light is 700nm, and violet light is at 400nm. This means that the polarising filter's bars would need to be very close to polarise/block this light.

# Phase
Phase is the difference between points on waves.
