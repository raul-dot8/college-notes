# What is a wave?
A wave is a transfer of energy without a net transfer of mass. 
# Types of waves
## Transverse
The direction of oscillation (of the particles or the fields) is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the net energy transfer.
## Longitudinal
The direction of oscillation of the particles is parallel to the direction of propagation of the net energy transfer.
Generally, these are often mechanical waves, found in the three states of matter as the particles of the material interact with each other. These are never found in an electromagnetic waves or fields.
## Mechanical
Waves travelling through media such as solid, liquid, and gas. The particles oscillating have a mass. This type of wave cannot propagate through a vacuum.
## Electromagnetic
The oscillation of an electric and a perpendicular magnetic field. This wave is massless and can propagate through a vacuum.

# Electric, Magnetic, and Direction
All 3 of these (the electric field, magnetic field, and the direction of propagation) are perpendicular to each other. The two fields are in phase.
